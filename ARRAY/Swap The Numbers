Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a. Just write the code to swap values of a and b at the specified place.

Examples

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2, now a = 2 and b = 1.
Input: a = 6, b = 7  
Output: 7 6 







#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b,temp;
    cin >> a >> b;
    // Write Code to Swap
   temp=a;
   a=b;
   b=temp;
    cout << a << " " << b << endl;
    return 0;
}
