The hiring team aims to find 3 candidates who are great collectively. Each candidate has his or her ability expressed as an integer. 3 candidates are great collectively if the product of their abilities is maximum. Given the abilities of some candidates in an array, arr[], return the maximum collective ability from the pool of candidates.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 3, 5, 6, 20]
Output: 1200
Explanation: Multiplication of 10, 6, and 20 is 1200.
Input: arr[] = [-10, -3, -5, -6, -20]
Output: -90
Explanation: Multiplication of -3, -5 and -6 is -90.








THIS IS BURT-FORCE APPROCH


        int  n=arr.size();
        int max_product=INT_MIN;
        if(n<3)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
            {
                for(int k=j+1;k<n;k++)
                {
                    int product=arr[i]*arr[j]*arr[k];
                    max_product= max(max_product,product);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max_product;
        // return product1;
        }
