Given an array, arr of positive integers. Find the third largest element in it. Return -1 if the third largest element is not found.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The third largest element in the array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] is 3.
Input: arr[] = [10, 2]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are less than three elements in the array, so the third largest element cannot be determined.












 int thirdLargest(vector<int> &arr) {
        // Your code here
        int n=arr.size();
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        if(n<3){
            return -1;
        }
        else{
            return arr[n-3];
        }
    }
