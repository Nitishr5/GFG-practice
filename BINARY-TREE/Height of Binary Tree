Given a binary tree, find its height.

The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [12, 8, 18, 5, 11] 
 
Output: 2
Explanation: One of the longest path from the root (node 12) goes through node 8 to node 5, which has 2 edges.













CODE PART================================>>>>>>>>>>>


class Solution {
  public:
    int height(Node* node) {
        // Base case
        if(node==NULL){
            return -1;
        }
        int left=height(node->left);
        int right=height(node->right);
        
        int ans= max(left,right)+1;
        return ans;
    }
};
